# Yet Another GBP Emulator (NeoGB Printer)
Yes, it's another Game Boy Printer emulator! The idea is just plug an SD card, print your images using a game compatible with Gameboy Printer and save as BMP image (big goal, but for the first version, it will be a PGM file)

Currently the code only generates a PGM output (with a fixed header to Gameboy Camera) and only if you push a button (pin G34)
If you want to use with another game, just change the 144 in the header to the number of lines in the output (without the first 3 lines)

You can check the compatibility list here: [Game Boy Printer Emulator - Games Support](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RQeTHemyEQnWHbKEhUy16cPxR6vA3YfeBbyx2tIXWaU/edit#gid=0)

# ToDo List:
- [ ] Update documetation (wiring, compatible devices, etc)
- [x] Update the code to support all games
- [ ] Use the original BMP library from Mofosyne C decompiler
- [ ] Create the file automatically when the emulator finishes to receive all the data (If possible)
- [ ] Write the BMP file on SD
