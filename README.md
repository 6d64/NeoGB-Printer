# NeoGB Printer

The main goal of Neo Printer is keep many simple as possible to the end user. Since the building to it's use.

You just need upload the code using the Arduino IDE, connect the components like described here, plug your SD card and print any image from [any game compatible with the original Game Boy Printer](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RQeTHemyEQnWHbKEhUy16cPxR6vA3YfeBbyx2tIXWaU/edit#gid=0)

Once you finish to print all your images, hold the button (see below) for a few seconds and all your images will be converted to BMP

This project is very similar to a popular solution available to buy. But this project is open source and have compatibility with all 107 games available with support for the Original Gameboy Printer.

## Software Setup
First of all, rename the `config.h.txt` to just `config.h` to import the pinout settings

This code has been created for a "DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1" [ESP32 based board](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/). All my tests was executed using [this chinese board](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mOCHLMT). You can use any other board available in the market. Just make sure of few points:\
* The number of total pins available in the board doesn't matter (Could be with 30 pins, 36 pins, 38 pins, whatever)
* It's a Dual Core module (some ESP32 modules are single core, like the ESP32-S2 and ESP32-C3)
* Have, at least, 2 SPI pins gourps [like this example](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-nGLtB2nUrDg/Wp6DQbzcJMI/AAAAAAAABq0/A6Z46p0SQSEdERWocWL94oUmeATMQre4wCLcBGAs/s1600/3.png) (normally it's called HSPI and VSPI, or sometimes have one called SPI and the other called VSPI or HSPI), make sure to check the pinout before buy one;

Some boards already have a SD Card slot built in. I never tested using this kind of board, but IN THEORY should works fine (as long as it has SPI pins available). If you want to use this type of board, DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

## Gameboy Link Cable Setup
Gameboy Original/Color Link Cable Pinout
```
 __________
|  6  4  2 |
 \_5__3__1_/ (at cable)

| Link Cable |  ESP32  |
|------------|---------|
| Pin 1      |   N/A   | <- 5v 
| Pin 2      | G19     | <- Serial Out (Serial In at the other end of the cable)
| Pin 3      | G23     | <- Serial In (Serial Out at the other end of the cable)
| Pin 4      |   N/A   | <- Serial Data
| Pin 5      | G18     | <- Clock Out
| Pin 6      | G       | <- GND

```

## SD Card Reader Setup
You need to use a [Micro SD Card Module](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/4000002592780.html) or a [SD Card Module](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/32523666863.html) to save the data. I highly recommend to get one, especially the [SD Card Module](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/32523666863.html), It's more stable than [Micro SD Card Module](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/4000002592780.html).
To use it, connect the pins following this schema
```
| SD ADAPTER |  ESP32  |
|------------|---------|
| CS         | G15     | 
| SCK        | G14     |
| MISO       | G27     | <-- DON'T USE THE G12... YOU CAN USE ANY OTHER PIN AVAILABLE
| MOSI       | G13     |
| GND        | G       |
| VCC/5v     | VIN     |
| 3v3        |   N/A   |

```

## Push Button Setup
You need to add a [little Push Button like this](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/1005002824489337.html) to convert all RAW data to BMP. To use it, just set the `#define BTN_PUSH` in `config.h` to any pin you want.

The function is simple:
* Single press: Force to refresh the image ID (only two games require this action: `E.T.: Digital Companion` and `Mary-Kate and Ashley Pocket Planner`)
* Long Press: Convert all RAW data to BMP

```

    |__________|

| Button | ESP32 |
|--------|-------|
| 1 or 2 |  3v3  | 
| 3 or 4 |  G34  | <-- I recommend to coonect a 10K resistor to the GND together, to act as a Pull Down.

```

## OLED Display Setup (optional)
You can add a [tiny oled display like this](https://pt.aliexpress.com/item/32672229793.html). To use it, you need to uncomment `#define USE_OLED` and the following lines   
The display will show the current wifi-config while in server mode, as well as the number of printed images when in printer mode 
```
| OLED DISPLAY|   ESP32   |
|-------------|-----------|
| GND         | GND       | 
| VIN         | 5v or 3v3 |
| SCL         | G22       | <-- YOU CAN USE ANY GPIO AVAILABLE
| SDA         | G21       | <-- YOU CAN USE ANY GPIO AVAILABLE

```

# ToDo List:
- [x] Update the code to support all games
- [x] Use the original BMP library from Mofosyne C decompiler
- [X] Write the BMP file on SD
- [X] Fix Palette issue with some games
- [X] Handle with storage % instead number of files
- [X] Parse the Output directory too, to return the next image ID
- [ ] Update documetation (wiring, compatible devices, etc)
- [ ] Create the file automatically when the emulator finishes to receive all the data (If possible)
- [ ] Add some kind of "FTP File Server" to download the images using a PC or Smartphone, without remove the SD card
